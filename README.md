# Facebook metrics data set

Facebook performance metrics of a renowned cosmetic brand's Facebook page. The data set is available at [UCI Machine Learning Repository: Facebook metrics data set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Facebook+metrics).

I've worked on an analysis of the data set to create a machine learning model to discover the features that are primarily responsible for model prediction. Unfortunately, from the low $R^2$ of different models used for the analysis, there doesn't seem to be any predictive power in the models. Consequently, no futher investigation into feature importance or permutation importance is attempted.
