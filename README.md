# Facebook metrics data set

Facebook performance metrics of a renowned cosmetic brand's Facebook page. The data set is available at [UCI Machine Learning Repository: Facebook metrics Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Facebook+metrics).

I've worked on a machine learning model analysis of the data set to pinpoint the features that are primarily responsible for model prediction.

## Update (2022-12-04)

Unfortunately from the low $R^2$ of different models used for the analysis, there doesn't seem to be any predictive power in the models, which consequently doesnt't warrant any futher investigation into feature importance or permutation importance.

No further analysis will be attempted.
